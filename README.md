# Intro
This semester (Spring 2016), I am taking a OS implementation class [CS 3210](https://tc.gtisc.gatech.edu/cs3210/2016/). For the lab assignment in this class, we are writing a unix-like operating systems kernel named JOS, which in many cases has a similar design to [xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/xv6.html). This repository is here to record my steps to implement the system. At the end of the project, the repo should have 7 branches, with a master branch and one branch for each lab.

For each lab branch, I will finish all the exercises and do at least one challege problem. In each lab branch, there is a answers-labX.txt file recording my answers to all questions besides coding. If you are not sure how the lab or coding stuff (build, run tests, etc.) work, check out our course website at [CS 3210](https://tc.gtisc.gatech.edu/cs3210/2016/). I will also keep a implementation log in this README file.
