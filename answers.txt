Exercise 3

(1) The first 32-bit executed is

mov $0x10,%ax

in address 0x7c32. Two things cause the switching. The first is setting the %cro to be 1, which enables 32-bit protected mode. The second is the long jump instruction at 0x7c2d, which forces the processor to change code segment register %cs and work in 32 bit mode.

(2) The last instruction of boot loader executed is to call entry function of kernel.

0x7d61:      call   *0x10018

The first instruction of kernel executed is

0x10000c:    movw   $0x1234,0x472

(3) The first instruction of kernel is located at physical address 0x10000c.

(4) The boot loader first read the elf header of kernel. It first find the number of program segments from the elf header and then read the program segment one by one. When reading each segment, boot loader convert them into integer number of sectors due to sector granularity. Then it reads the sectors which corresponds to a program segment until reading all the program segments into memory. In this way the boot loader decides the number of sectors to load.

Exercise 6

(1) They are different because at the point when BIOS enters boot loader, there is nothing at 0x100000. When boot loader enters kernel, it already loads kernel into memory at 0x100000.

(2) So the first 8 words is the first 32 bytes of the first loadable area in the ELF object obj/kern/kernel.

Exercise 7

The first instruction that would fail is

0x10002a:    jmp    *%eax

It fails because there is no such high physical address at 0xf010002f if paging is not enabled.

Exercise 8

1. The interface between kern/printf.c and kern/console.c is inc/stdio.h. Specifically console.c implement and export the void cputchar(char c) function. It is used by kern/printf.c to call lib/rintfmt.c to print each character to the VGA display and serial port.

2. The purpose of this code is to move the screen to next line if the last line is full. It first check whether the current position exceeds the size of the screen. If so, it uses memmove() to copy all the characters from the second line to the end to the first position in the screen buffer. Then it fills out the last line buffer with white character ' '. Finally, it moves the current cursor to the first position in the last line.

3. 
(1) Trace into the call to cprintf(), fmt is stored in the current stack pointer. It points to 0xf0101972, which points to the string "x %d, y %x, z %d\n". va points to the following 3 int arguments. It points to 0x4(%esp) and store the numbers 1, 3, 4 from top to down contiguously.

(2) It first calls vcprintf(fmt, ap), where fmt = 0xf0101972, pointing to the formatted string and ap = 0xf010ffd4, pointing to number 1. Then it calls cons_putc() through cputchar() at kern/print.c, its argument is 120, which is the ascii value for 'x'. Then it calls cons_putc() again with value 32 to print the space " ". When it reaches "%d", it calls va_arg inside getint() to get the value and move ap to next int. Before the call, ap points to 0xf010ffd4. After the call, it points to 0xf010ffd8.

4.  The output is "He110 World". cprintf calls vcprintf with formatted string "H%x Wo%s". Then vcprintf calls vprintfmt to print each character, number or string. When it reaches '%x', it print the first argument in va_list in hex format. 57616 in hex is 0xe110. It prints e110, then we get "He110 Wo". When it reaches "%s", it treats the second paramter as (char *) and print it out. The second parameter points to an unsigned number 0x00646c72. Due to little endianess, it is stored as 72 6c 64 00, which corresponds to the ascii value of characters "rld".

If x86 were big endian, we need to set i = 0x726c6400. We don't need to change 57616 because it is always treated as integer. When we write and read 57616 in C program, the endianess would be automatically taken care by the ISA.

5. The number printed after "y=" is not specific because it depends on what is previously on the stack. The formatted string indicates that there are two integers to be printed. So vcprintfmt will increment ap by 4 and print whatever value there in decimal format. So we get a random value.

6. Perhaps we need to change va_arg, such that it decrements the ap to get the next value, instead of incrementing.
